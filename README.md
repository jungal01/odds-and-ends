# odds and ends
This is a compilation of short scripts I wrote for fun. Some of it has actual practical use, others are little programming projects too small for a proper repository, while others still are experiments and examples for my own learning experience. As this repository is too generalized for a proper readme, in-depth explanations will be in each file, with a passing explanation for each file kept here.
